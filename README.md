# Lab1
# Submission Details
In this lab you will create five simple scripts. Write the scripts in code spaces or clone the repository and open the files in VSCode. 
Please note that you must complete the lab during the class hours and show your progress to the professor to receive the marks for the lab.

# Lab Objectives
- Create and execute simple python scripts which require creating and initializing variables, using string concatenation, print() function and simple arithmetic operations.

## Lab1a.py
- Open the file lab1a.py.
- The first three lines should be comments and display author name (you), name of the script (lab1a.py) and the description of the code.
- Next, create a variable called `message`
- Set the variable to equal to ‘Welcome to PRG101”
- Print `message`
- Use the builtin `type()` function and print the type of this variable.
- Add another print statement that uses the variable you just created and concatenate it with the statement “ Python is the future.”
- Next create another variable called `x` and assign it the value 10.
- Check its type using `type()` function.
- In the next statement reassign x to the value "hello".
- Check and print its type.
- What did you observe?  


## Lab1b.py
- Fill in the required fields in the comment section.
- The script should incorparate a variable called `num1` and take its value from user using input() function.
- The script should have another variable named `num2`.
- The value of `num2` should also be taken from user.
- Convert the variables to integer using int() function.
- Perform all the basic arithmatic operations on these two variables and print the output in the following format.
  ```Python
  num1 + num = ....
  num1 - num = ....
  num1 * num = ....
  num1 ** num = ....
  num1 / num = ....
  num1 // num = ....
  num1 % num = ....
  ```
  

## Lab1c.py 
- Fill in the required fields in the comment section.
- Import `math` module.
- The script should include a variable `r`.
- The value of `r` should be a number inputted from the user.
- Convert `r` to an integer with `int()` function.
- Using the constant `pi` from `math` module and compute the area of a circle based on `r` being radius.
- Then print the area to the user with the print function.

## Lab1d.py
- Fill in the required fields in the comment section.
-	The script should include a variable called `name`.
-	The value of the `name` should be your name.
-	Use the string method `.upper()` to convert the name to upper case.
-	The script should also include a variable `age`.
-	The value of `age` should be your age.
-	The script, when executed, should print out "How are you yourname? Happy xxth birthday!" To print this output use .format() method.
-	Next create a variable `words`.	The value of `words` should be "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
- Using indexing return the first and 17th charecters with print function.
- Using negative indexing return the word "jumps" and "quick".
- Return all charecturs in between index 2-15
- Print "uick brown fox ju" from `words`



## Lab1e.py
- Fill in the required feilds in the comment section.
- The script should include a variable called `quantity`.
- The value of `quantity` should be a decimal number of your choice.
- The script should also include a variable called `stock`.
- The value of `stock` should be a decimal number inputted by the user.
- Print the product of `quantity` and `stock` with 4 spaces before the answer using the module % formatting.
- Print the product of `quantity` and `stock` with 7 spaces before the answer and make sure the answer only goes to hundreadths using the module % formatting.
